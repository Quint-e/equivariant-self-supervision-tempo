# self-supervised-tempo - Tests


## Pytest
The tests are written with [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html). 

## Running the tests. 
Navigate to the test directory and simply run `pytest`. By default Pytest will look for files with name `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` and run them as tests. 
 
Alternatively, specify a given file with the tests to run, for example: `pytest test_augmentations.py`.
